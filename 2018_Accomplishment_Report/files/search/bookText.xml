               Students are required to complete at least one research before earning their degrees.  They are encouraged to conduct researches that may
               create impact not only to students of the institution but also to the fund of general knowledge. Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
               students on the other hand, are engaged in hardware and software development as an alternative tool or solution. Likewise, students are
               tapped to dwell on current and relevant topics and worked within the University Research Trust. They are trained to do both quantitative
               and qualitative approaches.
