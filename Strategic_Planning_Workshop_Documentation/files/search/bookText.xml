                   1.  College of Arts and Sciences

                       Dean Bettina Joyce  Ilagan presented the strategic plans of the College of Arts
                       and  Sciences.    Accordingly,  they  are  not  only  one  in  CAS,  but  they  are  also
                       TRUE, which stands for Train, Research, Utilize and Extend.














                                                     Dr. Bettina Joyce Ilagan, CAS

                       The body suggested to focus on strategies to address the internationalization of
                       the  University.      It  was  likewise  suggested  to  focus  on  areas  of  research  and
                       extension  that  are  related  to  Arts  and  Sciences  and  to  concentrate  on  the
                       thematic areas of the University.

                       Prof. Sedigo suggested the following:

                       a.  To connect the researches of the College to the extension to be conducted.
                       b.  Strengthen  the  existing  offering  and  concentrate  on  improving  the
                          performance in the licensure examination of the BS Psychology
                       c.  Prioritize  the  establishment  of  Centers  of  Development  or  Excellence  since
                          some of the program offerings are Level III re-accredited already.

                       Dr.  Robles  likewise  suggested  to  strengthen  instruction  and  concentrate  on
                       producing outcomes since CAS is a service college. Dr. A. Mojica on the other
                       hand, suggested on improving researches and extension works since they have
                       conducted some already.]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[Dr. Vida commented that external funding for researches are possible since the
                       College can venture into social and anthropological researches. Dr. Alava on the
                       other  hand,  said  that  the  College  can  continue  the  accomplishments  of  its
                       previous professors like the development of e-books.

                   2.  College of Engineering and Information Technology

                       Mr.  Marlon  Pereña,  Chairman  of  the  Department  of  Information  Technology
                       presented CEIT’s strategic plans.  The highlights of his presentation focused on
                       the use of technology and automation to be used mainly in instruction, research
                       and extension.  Furthermore, infrastructure are mostly for the development of IT
                       facilities.




















                                                     Prof. Marlon P. Pereña, CEIT

                       Dr. Robles suggested to concentrate on the production of the best and brightest
                       students, faculty and staff rather than attracting them.

                       Dr.  Vida  said  that  CEIT  has  the  most  number  of  patentable  products  and
                       innovation.  She  advised  CEIT  focal  personnel  to  coordinate  with  Dr.  Teddy
                       Tepora for possible patenting of fabricated products.

                       Prof.  Sedigo  advised  to  focus  on  specific  research  and  to  collaborate  all  its
                       research  undertakings.    Dr.  Sanchez,  asked  the  help  of  CEIT  personnel  and
                       students to develop a medical database for the students.

                       On  harmonization  of  programs,  Dr.  Polinga  suggested  to  harmonize  CEIT’s
                       programs  and  activities  with  the  Management  Information  System  (MIS).
                       Likewise, Dr. Manuel noted the need for streamlining of programs and revisiting
                       of the organizational structure to reflect the BS Office Administration.]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[3.  College of Education

                       the College.  Prof. Sedigo suggested to revisit the performances of the College’s
                       graduates  in  the  licensure  examinations  and  to  strategize  to  improve  their
                       performances.

























                                                      Dr. Editha G. Reyes, CEd


                       Among the issues and suggestions raised in the discussions were:

                            Possible splitting of the College to make clear-cut distinction of the
                              offerings, like the Child Development Center and Science Laboratory High
                              School.
                            Strict implementation of the retention policies
                            Inclusion of the competency appraisal for the BSE and BEE students prior
                              to graduation
                            Strict implementation of the comprehensive examinations
                            Patenting of the HRM and Science High School innovations
                            Preparation o for the COD and COE application by reviewing the
                              provisions in the CMO and preparing for them]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[4.  Naic Campus

                       The  strategic  plans  of  Naic  Campus  were  presented  by  Prof.  John  Xavier
                       Nepomuceno.  During  the  discussion,  Dr.  Vida  suggested  to  look  into  the
                       possibility  of  creating  a  Technology  Business  Incubator  (TBI)  in  the  campus.
                       Through this, technologies to be developed can easily be commercialized.

                       Prof. Sedigo advised the dean to collaborate with some agencies most especially
                       on  marine  technologies.    These  areas  may  include  the  operationalization  of
                       coastal  water  resources,  capacity  building  and  aggressive  recruitment  of
                       graduates.




















                                             Prof. John Xavier Nepomuceno, Naic Campus

                       Dr. Robles said that Naic Campus can conduct fishery resources research since
                       it  was  identified  as  NUCAF.    As  such,  it  can  concentrate  on  developing  the
                       pawikan sanctuary and can work on international linkages such as JICA, JOCB,
                       and  PEMSEA.  It  can  also  work  on  the  establishment  of  Marine  Biological
                       Research center.

                       Likewise,  Dr.  Vida,  suggested  to  concentrate  on  fishery  (inland  fishery)  and
                       coastal services management.

                   5.  Rosario Campus

                       Dr. Ariel Santos presented the strategic plan of the Rosario Campus.  What was
                       surprising was the downtrend enrolment.]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[Dr. Ariel Santos, Rosario Campus

                       The body suggested to:

                                   concentrate on resource generation
                                   research  collaboration  in  its  areas  of  expertise  such  as  prototype
                                     and design fabrication
                                   strengthen the banner programs – Industrial Technology
                                   publish  its  research  findings  in  refereed  journals  and  own  journal
                                     once accredited


                   6.  Carmona Campus

                       Prof. Cristina M. Signo presented the strategic plans.  She said that the campus
                       is so fortunate for the active support of the LGU and some of the infrastructure
                       will soon rise.


                       The following were the suggestions raised:


                                   Due to decreasing enrolment, the campus can benchmark some of
                                     its programs to strengthen the offerings
                                   Strengthen the Academe-Industry linkage
                                   Review the possibility of offering some courses which can become
                                     its flagship programs
                                   Take the opportunity of its presence in the industrial hub of the

                                                    Dr. Analita Magsino, CAFENR

                       Recognizing  some  of  the  College’s  excellent  programs  especially  its  Level  IV
                       program,  Dr.    Robles  suggested  to  still  improve  its  linkages  in  terms  of  the
                       number of MOAs and MOUs signed, approved and secured. Other suggestions
                       were:

                            Work on collaboration  with international research and funding agencies
                            Study the possibility of tie-up with ASEAN universities

                       School and Open Learning College.




















                                   Dr. Ma. Agnes Nuestro, Graduate School and Open Learning College


                       Prof.  Sedigo  suggested  that  the  Graduate  School  should  have  separate
                       extension  activities.    Dr.  Nuestro  said  that  each  college  has  its  own  extension
                       work  and  the  graduate  students  are  involved.    Dr.  Polinga  said  the  graduate
                       students can be tapped as speakers according to their expertise.

                       Dr. Robles suggested that the Graduate School can offer courses to support the
                       Department  of  Education  through  strengthening  of  the  learning  centers  in  the
                       campuses.    Along  with  this  is  the  possible  membership  to  the  International
                       Council  of  Distance  Education  and  involvement  in  the  transnational  education.
                       Involvement and participation of graduate in research can likewise be enhanced
                       through the Faculty and Students Research Capability Program of the University
                       (FSRCEP).

                       Other suggestions for consideration in the Graduate School were the following:


                            Offering of the graduate programs during weekdays and weeknights
                            Training of the graduate faculty to make them technology savvy
                            Observance of the intellectual property rights in the innovations and
                              discoveries of the graduate students]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[  Sponsorship of conferences of the graduate students

                   Dr. Vida commented that the University can concentrate of the commodity thrusts of
                   the University.  Through this, more research centers can be developed.  Dr. Alava
                   assured the support coming from the administration. He also suggested to revisit the
