The  thrust  of  the  Guidance  Services  Unit  is  to  formulate  a             program  that  will  lead  to  the  discovery  of  the  full  potentials  of  the  student.  In  this             regard, all the activities presented in the program are geared towards self-awareness,             self-advocacy,  and  self-direction,  which  are  believed  to  be  the  door  towards  self-             fulfilment and self-actualization.

As  a             developmental  program,  it  addresses  the  needs  of  all  students  by  facilitating  their             academic, career development, personal or social development, helping create positive             and safe learning climates in the University (main and branch campuses), as well as             helping  students  feel  connected  to  the  University  and  to  at  least one  or  two  caring             adult/s.

This  guidance  and  counseling  program  caters  to  the  most             essential factors of personality development through the attainment of the student’s             goals and development of one’s potential.                    The  concept  of  guidance  and  counseling  is  based  on  the  six  premises  that             underpin  the  organization  and  management  of  comprehensive  guidance  and             counseling programs:                 1.  Guidance  and  counseling  is  a  program.  Its  components  are  similar  to  other                    programs in education and include the following:                    a.  Student expectations (academic, personal/social, and career development)                    b.  Activities and processes to assist students in achieving expectations                    c.  Professionally certified personnel                    d.  Materials and resources                    e.  Program, personnel and results evaluation                2.  Guidance  and  counseling  is  comprehensive  and  developmental  in  nature.                    Guidance  and  counseling  activities  are  conducted  on  a  regular,  planned  and                    systematic basis to assist students to achieve guidance and counseling-related                    expectations.  Although  student’s  immediate  and  crisis  needs  must  be  met,  a                    major  focus  of  a  developmental  program  is  to  provide  all  students  with                    experiences to help them grow and develop. Guidance and counseling program                    is  comprehensive  that  a  full  range  of  activities  and  services  such  as                    assessment, information, consultation, counseling, referral, placement, follow-                    up and follow-through are provided.                3.  Guidance and counseling program assists all students to complete a degree /non-                    degree  in  college  and  earn  a  diploma/certificate  that  ensures  them  of  being                    prepared for opportunities after college.                4.  Guidance and counseling program features a team approach. A comprehensive,                    developmental  program  of  Guidance  and  Counseling  is  based  on  the                    assumption  that  all  administrators,  faculty  members,  instructors,  employees,                    and  staff  are  involved.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  understood  that  professionally                    certified school counselors are central to program. School counselors not only                    provide  direct  services  to  students  but  also  work  in  consultative  and                    collaborative relationship with the members of guidance and counseling team:                    University personnel, parents/guardians, and members of the community.                5.  Guidance and counseling program is developed through a systematic process of                    planning,  designing,  implementing,  evaluating  and  enhancing.  This  process                    assures  intentional  delivery  of  a  program  designed  to  address  established                    priorities                   GJMH2016","P a g e  | 5                 6.

Professional school counselors are advocates, leaders, collaborators and consultants who create             opportunities  for  equity  in  access  and  success  in  educational  opportunities  by  connecting  their             programs  to  the  mission  of  schools  and  subscribing  to  the  following  tenets  of  professional             responsibility:                  Each  person  has  the  right  to  be  respected,  be  treated  with  dignity  and  have  access  to  a                comprehensive school counseling program that advocates for and affirms all students from diverse                populations  including:  ethnic/racial  identity,  age,  economic  status,  abilities/disabilities,  language,                immigration  status,  sexual  orientation,  gender,  gender  identity/expression,  family  type,                religious/spiritual identity and appearance;                                                                                                                  -                direction  and  self-development  and  affirmation  within  one’s  group  identities,  with  special  care                being  given  to  students  who  have  historically  not  received  adequate  educational  services,  e.g.,                students  of  color,  students  living  at  a  low  socioeconomic  status,  students  with  disabilities  and                students from non-dominant language backgrounds;                  choices and how those choices will affect future opportunities;                              has the right to privacy and thereby the right to expect the school counselor/student                relationship to comply with all laws, policies and ethical standards pertaining to confidentiality in                the school setting;                                                            ol environments that school counselors help create, free                from abuse, bullying, neglect, harassment or other forms of violence.                   GJMH2016","P a g e  | 35                      In this document, ASCA specifies the principles of ethical behavior necessary to maintain the             high standards of integrity, leadership and professionalism among its members. The Ethical Standards             for School Counselors were developed to clarify the nature of ethical responsibilities held in common by             school counselors, supervisors/directors of school counseling programs and school counselor educators.             The purposes of this document are to:                   of school counseling programs and school counselor educators regardless of level, area, population                 served or membership in this professional association;                               -appraisal  and  peer  evaluations  regarding  school  counselors’  responsibilities  to                 students, parents/guardians, colleagues and professional associates, schools, communities and the                 counseling profession; and                   community members and courts of justice, of best ethical practices, values and expected behaviors                 of the school counseling professional.              A.1. Responsibilities to Students             Professional school counselors:                a.  Have  a  primary  obligation  to  the  students,  who  are  to  be  treated  with  dignity  and  respect  as                  unique individuals.                b. Are concerned with the educational, academic, career, personal and social needs and encourage                  the maximum development of every student.                c. Respect students’ values, beliefs and cultural background and do not impose the school counselor’s                  personal values on students or their families.                d. Are knowledgeable of laws, regulations and policies relating to students and strive to protect and                  inform students regarding their rights.                e. Promote the welfare of individual students and collaborate with them to develop an action plan for                  success.                f. Consider the involvement of support networks valued by the individual students.                g. Understand that professional distance with students is appropriate, and any sexual or romantic                  relationship with students whether illegal in the state of practice is considered a grievous breach                  of ethics and is prohibited regardless of a student’s age.                h. Consider the potential for harm before entering into a relationship with former students or one of                  their family members.              A.2. Confidentiality             Professional school counselors:               a. Inform individual students of the purposes, goals, techniques and rules of procedure under which                 they may receive counseling. Disclosure includes the limits of confidentiality in a developmentally                 appropriate manner. Informed consent requires competence on the part of students to understand                 the  limits  of  confidentiality  and  therefore,  can  be  difficult  to  obtain  from  students  of  a  certain                 developmental level.  Professionals  are aware  that  even  though  every attempt is  made  to  obtain                 informed consent it is not  always possible and when needed will make counseling decisions on                 students’ behalf.               GJMH2016","P a g e  | 36                 b. Explain the limits of confidentiality in appropriate ways such as classroom guidance lessons, the                 student handbook, school counseling brochures, school Web site, verbal notice or other methods of                 student,  school  and  community  communication  in  addition  to  oral  notification  to  individual                 students.               c. Recognize the complicated nature of confidentiality in schools and consider each case in context.                 Keep information confidential unless legal requirements demand that confidential information be                 revealed or a breach is required to prevent serious and foreseeable harm to the student. Serious and                 foreseeable harm is different for each minor in schools and is defined by students’ developmental                 and chronological age, the setting, parental rights and the nature of the harm. School counselors                 consult with appropriate professionals when in doubt as to the validity of an exception.               d. Recognize their primary obligation for confidentiality is to the students but balance that obligation                 with an understanding of parents’/guardians’ legal and inherent rights to be the guiding voice in                 their children’s lives, especially in  value laden issues. Understand the need to  balance students’                 ethical rights to make choices, their capacity to give consent or assent and parental or familial legal                 rights and responsibilities to protect these students and make decisions on their behalf.               e.  Promote  the  autonomy  and  independence  of  students  to  the  extent  possible  and  use  the  most                 appropriate and least intrusive method of breach. The developmental age and the circumstances                 requiring the breach are considered and as appropriate students are engaged in a discussion about                 the method and timing of the breach.               f. In absence of state legislation expressly forbidding disclosure, consider the ethical responsibility to                 provide information to an identified third party who, by his/her relationship with the student, is at                 a  high  risk  of  contracting  a  disease  that  is  commonly  known  to  be  communicable  and  fatal.                 Disclosure requires satisfaction of all of the following conditions:                                   lor recommends the student notify partner and refrain from further high-risk                    behavior                                                                                          al representative in                    writing as to the legalities of informing the partner               g. Request of the court that disclosure not be required when the release of confidential information                 may potentially harm a student or the counseling relationship.               h.  Protect  the  confidentiality  of  students’  records  and  release  personal  data  in  accordance  with                 prescribed  federal  and  state  laws  and  school  policies  including  the  laws  within  the  Family                 Education  Rights  and  Privacy  Act  (FERPA).  Student  information  stored  and  transmitted                 electronically  is  treated  with  the  same  care  as  traditional  student  records.  Recognize  the                 vulnerability  of  confidentiality  in  electronic  communications  and  only  transmit  sensitive                 information electronically in a way that is untraceable to  students’ identity. Critical information                 such as a student who has a history of suicidal ideation must be conveyed to the receiving school in                 a personal contact such as a phone call.                   GJMH2016","P a g e  | 37                   A.3. Academic, Career/College/Postsecondary Access and Personal/Social Counseling Plans             Professional school counselors:               a.  Provide  students  with  a  comprehensive  school  counseling  program  that  parallels  the  ASCA                National  Model  with  emphasis  on  working  jointly  with  all  students  to  develop  personal/social,                academic and career goals.               b. Ensure equitable academic, career, postsecondary access and personal/social opportunities for all                students through the use of data to help close achievement gaps and opportunity gaps.               c.  Provide  and  advocate  for  individual  students’  career  awareness,  exploration  and  postsecondary                plans  supporting  the  students’  right  to  choose  from  the  wide  array  of  options  when  they  leave                secondary education.              A.4. Dual Relationships             Professional school counselors:                a.  Avoid  dual  relationships  that  might  impair  their  objectivity  and  increase  the  risk  of  harm  to                   students (e.g., counseling one’s family members or the children of close friends or associates). If a                   dual relationship is unavoidable, the school counselor is responsible for taking action to eliminate                   or reduce the potential for harm to the student through use of safeguards, which might include                   informed consent, consultation, supervision and documentation.                b. Maintain appropriate professional distance with students at all times.                c.  Avoid  dual  relationships  with  students  through  communication  mediums  such  as  social                   networking sites.                d. Avoid dual relationships with school personnel that might infringe on the integrity of the school                   counselor/student relationship.              A.5. Appropriate Referrals             Professional school counselors:                a.  Make  referrals  when  necessary  or  appropriate  to  outside  resources  for  student  and/or  family                  support. Appropriate referrals may necessitate informing both parents/guardians and students of                  applicable  resources  and  making  proper  plans  for  transitions  with  minimal  interruption  of                  services. Students retain the right to discontinue the counseling relationship at any time.                b. Help educate about and prevent personal and social concerns for all students within the school                  counselor’s scope of education and competence and make necessary referrals when the counseling                  needs are beyond the individual school counselor’s education and training. Every attempt is made                  to  find  appropriate  specialized  resources  for  clinical  therapeutic  topics  that  are  difficult  or                  inappropriate  to  address  in  a  school  setting  such  as  eating  disorders,  sexual  trauma,  chemical                  dependency and other addictions needing sustained clinical duration or assistance.                c. Request a release of information signed by the student and/or parents/guardians when attempting                  to develop a collaborative relationship with other service providers assigned to the student.                   GJMH2016","P a g e  | 38                  d.  Develop  a  reasonable  method  of  termination  of  counseling  when  it  becomes  apparent  that                  counseling assistance is no longer needed or a referral is necessary to better meet the student’s                  needs.               A.6. Group Work             Professional school counselors:                a. Screen prospective group members and maintain an awareness of participants’ needs, appropriate                  fit and personal goals in relation to the group’s intention and focus. The school counselor takes                  reasonable precautions to protect members from physical and psychological harm resulting from                  interaction within the group.                b. Recognize that best practice is to notify the parents/guardians of children participating in small                  groups.                c.  Establish  clear  expectations in  the  group  setting,  and clearly  state  that  confidentiality  in group                  counseling cannot be guaranteed. Given the developmental and chronological ages of minors in                  schools,  recognize  the  tenuous  nature  of  confidentiality  for  minors  renders  some  topics                  inappropriate for group work in a school setting.                d. Provide necessary follow up with group members, and document proceedings as appropriate.                e. Develop professional competencies, and maintain appropriate education, training and supervision                  in group facilitation and any topics specific to the group.                f. Facilitate group work that is brief and solution focused, working with a variety of academic, career,                  college and personal/social issues.              A.7. Danger to Self or Others             Professional school counselors:                a. Inform parents/guardians and/or appropriate authorities when a student poses a danger to self or                  others.  This  is  to  be  done  after  careful  deliberation  and  consultation  with  other  counseling                  professionals.                b. Report risk assessments to parents when they underscore the need to act on behalf of a child at                  risk; never negate a risk of harm as students sometimes deceive in order to avoid further scrutiny                  and/or parental notification.                c. Understand the legal and ethical liability for releasing a student who is in danger to self or others                  without proper and necessary support for that student.              A.8. Student Records             Professional school counselors:                a.  Maintain  and  secure  records  necessary  for  rendering  professional  services  to  the  student  as                  required by laws, regulations, institutional procedures and confidentiality guidelines.                b. Keep sole possession records or individual student case notes separate from students’ educational                  records in keeping with state laws.                c. Recognize the limits of sole possession records and understand these records are a memory aid for                  the  creator and in  absence  of  privileged  communication may  be  subpoenaed  and  may  become                  GJMH2016","P a g e  | 39                    educational records when they are shared or are accessible to others in either verbal or written                  form or when they include information other than professional opinion or personal observations.                d.  Establish  a  reasonable  timeline  for  purging  sole  possession  records  or  case  notes.  Suggested                  guidelines  include  shredding  sole  possession  records  when  the  student  transitions  to  the  next                  level, transfers to another school or graduates. Apply careful discretion and deliberation before                  destroying sole possession records that may be needed by a court of law such as notes on child                  abuse, suicide, sexual harassment or violence.                e.  Understand  and  abide  by  the  Family  Education  Rights  and  Privacy  Act  (FERPA,  1974),  which                  safeguards student’s records and allows parents to have a voice in what and how information is                  shared with others regarding their child’s educational records.              A.9. Evaluation, Assessment and Interpretation             Professional school counselors:                a.    Adhere  to  all  professional  standards  regarding  selecting,  administering  and  interpreting                  assessment measures and only utilize assessment measures that are within the scope of practice                  for school counselors and for which they are trained and competent.                b.  Consider  confidentiality  issues  when  utilizing  evaluative  or  assessment  instruments  and                  electronically based programs.                c. Consider the developmental age, language skills and level of competence of the student taking the                  assessments before assessments are given.                d.  Provide  interpretation  of  the  nature,  purposes,  results  and  potential  impact  of                  assessment/evaluation measures in language the students can understand.                e. Monitor the use of assessment  results and interpretations, and take reasonable steps to prevent                  others from misusing the information.                f.  Use  caution  when  utilizing  assessment  techniques,  making  evaluations  and  interpreting  the                  performance  of  populations  not  represented  in  the  norm  group  on  which  an  instrument  is                  standardized.                g. Assess the effectiveness of their program in having an impact on students’ academic, career and                  personal/social  development  through  accountability  measures  especially  examining  efforts  to                  close achievement, opportunity and attainment gaps.              A.10. Technology             Professional school counselors:                a.  Promote  the  benefits  of  and  clarify  the  limitations  of  various  appropriate  technological                 applications.  Professional  school  counselors  promote  technological  applications  (1)  that  are                 appropriate  for  students’  individual  needs,  (2)  that  students  understand  how  to  use  and  (3)  for                 which follow-up counseling assistance is provided.                b. Advocate for equal access to technology for all students, especially those historically underserved.                c. Take appropriate and reasonable measures for maintaining confidentiality of student information                 and educational records stored or transmitted through the use of computers, facsimile machines,                 telephones, voicemail, answering machines and other electronic or computer technology.                d. Understand the intent of FERPA and its impact on sharing electronic student records.                 GJMH2016","P a g e  | 40                  e.

A.11. Student Peer Support Program             Professional school counselors:                a. Have unique responsibilities when working with peer helper or student assistance programs and                  safeguard the welfare of students participating in peer to peer programs under their direction.                b. Are ultimately responsible for appropriate training and supervision for students serving as  peer                  support individuals in their school counseling programs.              B. RESPONSIBILITIES TO PARENTS/GUARDIANS             B.1. Parent Rights and Responsibilities             Professional school counselors:                a.  Respect  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  parents/guardians  for  their  children  and  endeavor  to                  establish, as appropriate, a collaborative relationship with parents/guardians to facilitate students’                  maximum development.                b.
