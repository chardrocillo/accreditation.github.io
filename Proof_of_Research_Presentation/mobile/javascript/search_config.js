Lewis, Juancho D. Espineli          Abstract:  Coffee  farmers  or  growers  have  difficulty  in  classifying  nutritional  deficiencies  in  coffee  plants.  Proper  detection  of  these  nutritional         deficiencies could help them in giving proper intervention to plants. The study was conducted to classify and detect the nutritional deficiencies in coffee         plants  using  image  processing  and  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN).  Once  the  nutritional  deficiency  is  identified,  the  prototype  will  display         recommended fertilizer for the plant. One thousand images with eight nutritional deficiencies were used in the study namely, Boron (B), Calcium (Ca),         Iron (Fe), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc (Z). The study covered the four varieties of coffee named Arabica,         Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica existing in the Philippines. The capturing of images for testing and training the dataset were  done in coffee farms and         nurseries in Cavite State University, National Coffee Research, Development and Extension Center (NCRDEC) and Amadeo, Cavite. Experimental and         development research designs were  used.  Image processing  techniques was  utilized  in converting the  images  into grayscale and binary  values for         threshold  and  segmentation.  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  provides  the  predicted  nutritional  deficiencies  in  the  coffee  plants  through         classification and detection. Results shows that CNN has a high accuracy in detecting and classifying the nutritional deficiencies in coffee plants. The         prototype was evaluated, and results shows that it is an effective alternative for classifying and detecting the nutritional deficiencies in coffee plants.

The ground truth (t) is determined by         the  actual  number  of  leaves  with  nutritional  deficiencies.  In         determining  the  nutritional  deficiencies,  the  researchers  with         agriculturists and soil expert manually verify the leaves. Lastly,         result (r) is determined by the number of leaves with nutritional         deficiencies detected by the algorithm.         3.11 Statistical Treatment of Data         After data collection, the raw scores were tallied and tabulated         in a columnar sheet using Microsoft Excel.
